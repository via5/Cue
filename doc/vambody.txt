1 Body parts
============
Cue has a higher level view of a person's body than Vam and needs to know how
the various parts of the model are arranged to distribute them into body parts.

Each body part has a type:

  - rigidbody
    the body part has a main rigidbody and a controller, basically anything that
    shows as a "somethingControl" in the atom selection

  - trigger
    the body part has a trigger that can activate when something touches it

  - collider
    this is a body part that doesn't really have a Vam equivalent and Cue has
    to approximate, such as glutes (no controller) or forearms (only elbow and
    shoulder controllers)

  - internal
    special case for eyes

  - strapon
    special case for penis on females

  - none
    this body part doesn't exist yet


These values define the body part:

  - part
    the name of the body part in Cue (see BodyPartsEnum.cs)

  - name
    the name of the rigidbody, trigger or collider; can be an array if the
    body part is composed of multiple rigidbodies, such as the hips

  - controller
    name of the controller associated with this body part; used for automatic
    linking and detecting grabs

  - colliders
    array of collider names that are used to detect proximity to the body part

    for example, Cue tries to figure out if the player's hand is close to
    someone's head; the closest distance between any collider on the hand and
    any collider on the head is used to determine the actual distance

    the more colliders are used, the more accurate the detection, but the slower
    it is; there should be as few colliders as possible, while still covering
    as much as the body part's volume

  - rigidbody
    for collider types, this is the closest rigidbody to the body part; used for
    automatic linking, since controllers can only link to rigidbodies

  - forceReceiver
    for rigidbody types, this is the rigidbody that is used when applying forces
    during animations; this is normally the rigidbody from `name`, but some
    parts may use a different one


Two more values can be used to create different body parts for males and
females, or when advanced colliders are on or off. Vam uses different models
for males and females: most of the stuff is the same, but not all of it. If
"Advanced colliders" are off, Vam uses fewer colliders on the model and with
different names.

  - sex
    can be "male" or "female"; if not given, the body part applies to both

  - advanced
    can be "yes" or "no"; if not given, the body part applies to both


2 Hands
=======
Some animations in Cue need to know more about the positions of the fingers on
a hand, as well as which morphs to use to animate them.

  - type
    "left" or "right"

  - fistMorph
    name of a morph that can make a fist

  - fingersInOutMorph
    name of a morph that can make the fingers go in and out laterally

  - rigidbody
    the rigidbody associated with this hand

  - bones
    the names of three bones for each finger, from closest to the palm to the
    fingertip (in order: proximal, intermediate and distal)
