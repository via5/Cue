=====
    excitement (float, [0, 1])
      character's excitement value, orgasm at 1

    tiredness (float, [0, 1])
      how tired a character is:
         - "base" tiredness starts at 0, goes up slightly for every orgasm,
           decays when excitement stays low enough
         - "actual" tiredness is never below base, but always shoots up to 1.0
           quickly after orgasm and slowly goes back to base

    energy (float, [0, 1])
      how energetic a character is, goes up with excitement but is dampened by
      tiredness; see energyTirednessFactor

    busy
      used for some gaze targets; whether a person is currently doing an action
      where they're unlikely to look away, such as a HJ, BJ, etc.

    weight
      each gaze target has a weight as a number; to decide which target a person
      should look at next, the chance of a target being picked is its weight
      divided by the sum of the weight of all targets (that is, the higher the
      weight, the more chances a target has of getting picked)

    personal space
      a character is inside another character's personal space when certain body
      parts are close enough (this is an expensive check, so only some body
      parts are handled, such as hands, head, chest, hips, genitals and feet)

    groped
      whether a character's head, breasts or genitals are currently being
      touched by another character

    sex
      includes both penetration and groping

====
Controls what characters are looking at.

    Durations
    ---------
    gazeDuration (seconds, float)
      time it takes to move the head to follow the eyes

    gazeRandomIntervalMinimum (seconds, float)
    gazeRandomIntervalMaximum (seconds, float)
      time to wait before picking the next target


    Avoidance
    ---------
    avoidGazePlayer (bool)
      whether to avoid looking at the player at all times (see also
      maxExcitementForAvoid)

      whether to avoid looking at other characters having sex but not involved
      with this character

    maxExcitementForAvoid ([0-1], float)
      excitement value above which avoidance is disabled

    avoidDelayAfterOrgasm (seconds, float)
      time after orgasm during which avoidable is disabled (starts after the
      post-orgasm state)


    Weights
    ------------
    lookAboveMaxWeight (float)
      looking at a target directly above the character's head when mood is
      normal or post-orgasm; this weight is multiplied by the character's
      energy

    lookAboveMaxWeightOrgasm (float)
      looking at a target directly above the character's head during orgasm;
      this weight is multiplied by the character's energy


    naturalRandomWeight (float)
      looking at a random point when not busy

    naturalOtherEyesWeight (float)

    otherEyesExcitementWeight (float)
       used with naturalOtherEyesWeight and busyOtherEyesWeight: multiplied by
       the target's excitement and added to those weights; this is used to

       if this character is giving a HJ, looking at the other character's eyes

      or the penetrator's eyes genitals

    otherGropedEyesWeight
    otherGropedTargetWeight
    otherGropedSourceEyesWeight
      while being groped, looking at the character's eyes or body part or the
      groper's eyes


Excitement
==========
Controls some excitement values that are not physiological.

    otherSexExcitementRateFactor (float)
      the sum of all the excitement rates (not values) of all other characters
      in the scene is multiplied by this number; the result is added to the rate
      at which this character's excitement is going up

      this is used to increase the excitement of a character if other characters
      are getting excited

    maxOtherSexExcitement (float, [0, 1])
      the highest excitement a character can reach using only the excitement
      of other characters; this avoids orgasms just by looking at people

    energyTirednessFactor
      impact of tiredness on excitement to determine energy; energy is
      `excitement - (tiredness * energyTirednessFactor)`, clamped [0, 1]
