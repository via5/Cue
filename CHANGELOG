features:
  - Cue can now detect when body parts are rubbing against each other and at
    what velocity, so excitement will rise automatically during penetration if
    there's enough movement

    running the thrust event is still more robust because excitement will
    always continue to rise even if body parts become misaligned and stop
    touching, which happens often for frottage

  - excitement will now rise correctly with toys

  - auto hands and head: moving hands or head close to genitals will start the
    appropriate event, can be disabled in options; each hand is independent and
    will start/stop if necessary after being grabbed and moved

  - hand linker: now uses a custom, internal implementation managed by Cue
    instead of VaM's Parent Link connection, and so can link more precisely
    to targets; this also fixes body parts being difficult to move in Play Mode
    (because VaM ignores controllers that are linked when multiple body parts
    overlap)

  - integration with ToumeiHitsuji's DiviningRod: genitals are always enabled,
    but hands and mouth are disabled unless the corresponding event is started

  - voice: supports kissing an bj sounds from VAMMoan, can be disabled in
    options

  - orgasms are synced across multiple characters when excitement is close
    enough

  - new personalities: annoyed and angry

  - reorganised options into several tabs, added more:
      - treat strapon as physical for excitement
      - enable look at camera
      - disable idle animation

  - zap: some actions like the player touching genitals can "zap" a character,
    triggering head movements, expressions and moans

  - slap: thrust animation now drives some facial expressions on each thrust,
    might make noises in a future update


changes:
  - advanced colliders are now required
  - idle animation has more movement
  - removed most voice settings from Cue, caused more problems than anything
  - hj/bj speed now changes based on excitement and have slightly more movements
  - many tweaks to thrust animation
  - eyeTargetControl now always hidden, can only be selected from the person's
    Select menu
  - devmode only: all targets that are off are now hidden in play mode

fixes:
  - many fixes for excitement not rising when it should; characters should be
    much more responsive now
  - many fixes for gaze getting stuck or not responding to emergencies like
    orgasms or head grabs
  - fixed head and hands snapping after kiss, hj or bj animations
  - detect Embody passenger mode to disable head movements
  - sucking finger should trigger less often
  - fixed hands being closed too often and morphs still being driven after the
    hands are attached to something
  - fixed multiple strapons in the same scene only working for one


1.1     2022-01-17

features:
  - now uses VAMMoan from hazmhox instead of MacGruber's Life for breathing and
    voices, Life is still required for gazing

    the plugin preset includes VAMMoan, but it can be added manually to atoms
    for existing scenes

    Cue will automatically disable Life's Breathing and DriverBreathing scripts
    so they don't interfere with VAMMoan

  - new menu options in the options, Menu tab:
    - the VR menu can be disabled on the left or right hand
    - added a delay before showing the VR menu, defaults to 0.5 seconds
    - custom buttons with standard triggers can be added to the menu

  - added buttons in the "Main" options tab to export and import the options


changes:
  - females with advanced colliders disabled are handled correctly

  - disabled voice pitch being automatically based on scale, wasn't reliable

  - cleaned up the desktop HUD

  - characters will prefer looking forwards when gazing at random targets,
    prevents looking straight down or up for no reason

  - increased the distance when attempting to start a Hand event; makes it less
    likely to get a "no target" message, but the hand might find unexpected
    targets

  - slightly slower max speed for the thrust animations

  - added in a few more expressions from AshAuryn and cotyounoyume, if available


fixes:
  - fixed some animations not stopping properly during orgasms

  - some options would not show the correct value after loading a scene



1.0.1   2021-12-16

- excitement would still be going up after hand is deactivated if it was the
  right hand on male genitals

- tentative fix for the VR menu not being functional on some controllers

- male characters would not have their excitement go up if the thrust was
  activated on the female

- added a global excitement speed in the options

- desktop: moved the hud to the right side of the window, it will now be hidden
  when the UI is hidden

- desktop: stopped changing selected character when clicking atoms in the scene

- added a new "Debug input" tab in dev mode to help diagnose problems with the
  VR menu
