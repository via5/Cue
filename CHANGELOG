1.1     2022-01-17

features:
  - now uses VAMMoan from hazmhox instead of MacGruber's Life for breathing and
    voices, Life is still required for gazing

    the plugin preset includes VAMMoan, but it can be added manually to atoms
    for existing scenes

    Cue will automatically disable Life's Breathing and DriverBreathing scripts
    so they don't interfere with VAMMoan

  - new menu options in the options, Menu tab:
    - the VR menu can be disabled on the left or right hand
    - added a delay before showing the VR menu, defaults to 0.5 seconds
    - custom buttons with standard triggers can be added to the menu

  - added buttons in the "Main" options tab to export and import the options


changes:
  - females with advanced colliders disabled are handled correctly

  - disabled voice pitch being automatically based on scale, wasn't reliable

  - cleaned up the desktop HUD

  - characters will prefer looking forwards when gazing at random targets,
    prevents looking straight down or up for no reason

  - increased the distance when attempting to start a Hand event; makes it less
    likely to get a "no target" message, but the hand might find unexpected
    targets

  - slightly slower max speed for the thrust animations

  - added in a few more expressions from AshAuryn and cotyounoyume, if available


fixes:
  - fixed some animations not stopping properly during orgasms

  - some options would not show the correct value after loading a scene



1.0.1   2021-12-16

- excitement would still be going up after hand is deactivated if it was the
  right hand on male genitals

- tentative fix for the VR menu not being functional on some controllers

- male characters would not have their excitement go up if the thrust was
  activated on the female

- added a global excitement speed in the options

- desktop: moved the hud to the right side of the window, it will now be hidden
  when the UI is hidden

- desktop: stopped changing selected character when clicking atoms in the scene

- added a new "Debug input" tab in dev mode to help diagnose problems with the
  VR menu
